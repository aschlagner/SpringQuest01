# SEA8 - SpringQuest 01 - Start

Challenge: Hello, I'm the Doctor

You will create some routes using a controller:

- Creates a Spring project, and transforms the application into a controller.
- Choose 4 people who played the character of the Doctor (see here for the complete list).
- For each of the 4 incarnations you have chosen, create a /doctor/_number_ route that returns the name corresponding to the number. For example:

    - for the url /doctor/1 : the method returns "William Hartnell".
    - for the url /doctor/10 : the method returns "David Tennant".
    - for the url /doctor/13 : the method returns "Jodie Whittaker".

- the root / returns a list of urls for which you have provided mappings, in the form of HTML links -- think of the HTML tags _ul_ and _li_ to contain your tags _a_.
- Push your project content into a GitHub repository and post your repository link as a solution.


Validation criterias

- The controller contains 5 routes.
- The first 4 routes return the name of an incarnation mapped to its number.
- The root returns the links to the other mappings.
- The code is available on GitHub.
